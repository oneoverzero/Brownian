# TRAC - Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Brownian

Issue, to-do, and wish list, tracking file for the Brownian development project.

## ISSUES

 - _(smpb, 24/11/2011)_ At every single restart of the bot, the RSS module parses all the feeds again and floods the channel with notifications.

## TO-DO

 - _(smpb, 24/11/2011)_ Deprecate this file and move all of this to a proper platform. Say, Github.

## WISH LIST

 - _(smpb, 24/11/2011)_ The bot's very own internal karma meter:
   - He dislikes people that 'botslap' him often
   - He likes people that 'botsnack' him (but not too often!)
   - He "feels" a kinship to those who have taught him more
   - Boilerplate replies (like greetings) should vary according to these metrics
