     (Will now accept <set foo="you're"> correctly, before it would have parsed
     it as <set foo="you">. Will now NOT work with mis-matched quotes... which
     it probably never should have. EG: <set foo="bar'>)
   * Fix bug in xchat format - was not recognizing joins
   * Fix really old bug with foulwords - was only applying the wordbreak settings
     to the first and last words in the list of foulwords.  Now applies it to
     each word.
   * Add note to lang.txt that the <set lang="XX"> line should be inserted into
     the configuration file. Some users were confused about this.

     ignored words if this is set.  Will output a blank line after trying 20
     random quotes if all 20 random quotes were ignored.
   * Add support for HydraIRC logfiles (thanks, David Lynch)
   * When a logfile had no matching lines according to the format, pisg
     outputted that no lines were found in the logfile. This was confusing
     because files in the wrong format usually contained lines. Now be more
     verbose.
   * ShowOps option added. Has similar effect as ShowVoices and ShowHalfops.

     URL's (new config option)
   * When CharSet is not 'iso-8859-1' or 'iso-8859-15', don't provide
     conversions for characters. Fixes problems for many other languages, e.g.
     greek, korean etc.

     super long quotes showing up - BugID#594618)
   * Only match emails if it begins at the beginning of a line or after
     something other than ':' URL on that line. Fixes BugID#618540
   * Strip DOS Formatting from files - Fixes space at end of line BugID#628580
   * Fixed bug in hour tracking - Formats hours to 2 digits correctly now,
     previously was only forcing to 2 digit times if there was a time offset
     configured.  Fixes BugID#632883
   * Fixed bug - shouldn't have been grabbing 2 parts of the pircbot string
     to variables, was part of Rev 1.3 but apparently I forgot to actually put
     in that part.  Thanks Marc Roberts for pointing this out. BugID#651485
   * Added support for 'DC++' format, used by Direct Connect hub chat
   * Fixed bug in infobot format -- was matching any line that began lowercase

   * Fixed a bug in logsuffix handling where pisg would blow up if the
     'logsuffix' expression did not return dates for every filename.  It will
     now not parse any files that logsuffix does not match.

     have a sex-dependent color in the stats page. (E.g. one color for males,
     another for females etc.) (thanks, Olivier 'Babar' Raginel)
   * For languages which have a general unknown-sex verb, this can now be
     specified. E.g. French has 'un' for male, 'une' for females and 'un(e)'

     set by the new 'bg_link', 'bg_hlink' and 'bg_vlink' options.
   * New option: 'default_pic' makes it possible to display a default picture
     for a user if no picture defined. For example to display a picture

   * More work on the object oriented goal of pisg:
      - cleanups, don't use globals in modules, define these in the object.
      - add HTMLGenerator.pm, and move all HTML generation code from pisg.pl
        to this new module.
      - New module Pisg.pm brings the rest of the main code into it's own
        module, this means that Pisg is no longer dependent of pisg.pl.

        Again, please report back if you find any trouble with any of these
        changes.

   * Better logic when no channels are defined. Instead of just defaulting to
     #channel and channel.log, then force the user to define these on either
     commandline or in the config file. This should be better for first-time
     users.
   * Ship developer docs in docs/dev/ instead of just dumping it in docs/,
     docs/ should be for end users.
   * Various updates to language templates

pisg (0.22) - Sat, Sep 15th 2001
   * pisg.cfg now supports regexs in user.cfg when 'regexp_aliases' is
     enabled. (thanks, Phil Gregory)
   * When using logdirs, files is now sorted properly, so files are read in the
     right order (thanks, Sascha Lüdecke)
   * A bunch of English grammar corrections (thanks, Phil Gregory)
   * Words like //www is now being ignored as they should.
   * Instead of 'slaps' we now have 'violence', so one can define their own
     action lines to be counted. Like '/me hits nick on the forehead',
     configured by the 'violent' variable.
   * pisg is undergoing a large change of it's code structure, meaning that
     things will be built with modules instead of one giant Perl script,
     making it easier to maintain and read, and it will enable us to make pisg
     get data, or parse data from another source than a logfile; for example
     an SQL database, *sometime*. This means that pisg is now coming with a
     new subdir 'modules/' containing all the modules pisg need.  (thanks to
     Phil Gregory) if you expierence any problems with this change, please
     report back. 
   * Moved some documentation to a new 'docs/' folder.
   * Joins wasn't working in mIRC format, fixed.
   * Support both [HH::mm::ss] and [HH::mm] in mIRC logformats.
   * Timebars was broken when using timeoffset, showing the wrong colors
     comparing with the legend.
   * Many bugs in documentation fixed, should be cleaner now.
   * Usual minor optimizations and fixes

pisg (0.21) - Mon, Aug 27th 2001

   * Added "Most referenced URLs".
   * Stop matching 'user@host blah' as a mailto link.
   * Fix a word counting bug - was counting a lot less words than in the
     previous version.
   * Supplied some extra info to the 'got kicked' stats, now it shows an
     example kick line from the stats. (Thanks to Michael Dales for 
     show_kickline-patch)
   * The same for 'most slaps', 'most slapped', 'most actions' and
     'most shouted' stats. Every option has it's own activation_variable,
     see CONFIG-README for more infos
   * Display the remaining nicks on the stats page (those who didnt reach the
     stats at all)
   * Display the total count of topics that were set
   * Some small HTML validation fixes
   * Fix: pisg didn't find the alias for the kicker.
   * Stop hardcoding filenames in 'legend'
   * Removed support for unnamed arguments on commandline, everyone should now
     use the named arguments. (For example you must do 'pisg.pl -l
     logfile-name', and not just do 'pisg.pl chan logfile format maintainer')
   * Add support for 'sex' for users in pisg.cfg, this will make the stats
     always mention text with the right sex when saying for example 'she was
     very ..'

     background picture to the page (Vetinari)
   * If pisg can't find the config file in the current directory (when running
     from crontab), then try opening the config file in which pisg.pl resides
     instead..
   * <words foul="..."> is now known as <set words="...">
   * Add new options 'show_wpl' and 'show_cpl', this enables user to view the
     'chars per line' and 'words per line' in the 'most active nicks',
     disabled by default.
   * New option 'show_time', this will display a small bar in the 'most active
     nicks' of when the respective people actually speak. [enabled]
   * Because of the above change, there is new png files for pisg, remember to
     use the new ones and not the old ones! (thanks Christian Legler)
   * Remember to distribute the 'FORMATS' file (was missed in the last two
     releases)
   * Swedish translation (thanks to Andreas Henriksson)
   * New feature: 'Most actions'

     words in the stats.

   * Fix critical bug where <channel="#chan"> in pisg.cfg didn't work at all.

     hopefully encourages people to send in the missing template(s))

   * Small updates to Danish translation
   * Small bug in documentation fixed

pisg (0.18) - Mon, Aug 6th 2001

   * Added pisg.cfg support which now obsoletes user.cfg, in this file
     everything should be set, instead of in the script - this makes it easier
     upgrading pisg. Read CONFIG-README in order to "understand" it.
   * Commandline option -c is now -ch
   * Uncompress files with *.gz and *.bz2 automatically (Sascha Lüdecke)
   * Add new feature --prefix, this works on commandline so you only get logs
     starting with what you specify, for example -p '#mychan' will only get
     dir/#mychan* files. (Sascha Lüdecke)
   * Fix op tracking with bxlog logs
   * Added Foulwords-Variable to pisg.cfg
   * Make pisg die when there is no files in logdir

   * Started to distribute various scripts with pisg:

       mIRC format (Emil Mikulic <darkmoon7@optushome.com.au>)
