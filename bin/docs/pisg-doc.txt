What is pisg?

   pisg is an IRC statistics generator. It takes IRC logfiles and
   turns them into nice looking stats.

   In general, you would do something like this to get it running:

     * Enable logging in an IRC bot, or in your IRC client. The
       log will be outputted into a file.
     * You set up pisg, you define the channel name, and the path
       to the logfile you created.
     * You run pisg, pisg runs the log through and create
       statistics, it then creates an HTML page which you can
       upload to a webserver.
     __________________________________________________________

What are the requirements to run pisg?

     * An IRC client or bot where pisg supports the output
       logfile.
     * Any operating system which Perl runs on, this includes
       popular OSes such as Linux, FreeBSD, Windows and Mac. You
       will have a hard time finding an OS where Perl isn't
       supported. For Windows this means that you need to download
       ActivePerl.
     * Optional - a system to host the statistics page 24 hours a
       day, 7 days a week.
     * Optional - a system to log the channel, 24 hours a day, 7
       days a week.
     __________________________________________________________

Setting up pisg for the first time

   Most configuration happens through the pisg.cfg file, the file
   format is made to be easy to read, and easy to extend for
   further use. It uses an XML-like format, with elements and
   attributes.
     __________________________________________________________

Setting up a channel

   An element called Channel is made for defining channels, a
   quick example of a channel is here:

    <channel="#channel">
     Logfile = "channel.log"
     Format = "mIRC"
     Maintainer = "John"
     OutputFile = "mychan.html"
    </channel>


   The above will define a Channel called #channel, the logfile
   pisg will look for is called channel.log and the Format of the
   logfile will be mIRC. The Maintainer (which will be stated on
   the output page) is John.

   That is basically it! Now, there are a lot more options that
   you can use for your channels, for this please refer to the
   reference documentation.

   Also be-aware of the fact that pisg uses various images to show
   the time-related bars. These images are placed in the gfx/
   folder and should be placed into the same directory as your
   outputted HTML file.
     __________________________________________________________

Specifying user options

   User options are set with a simple XML-like syntax in the form:
   <user nick="NICK" option="VALUE">

   Remember, the nick is always required. For example to add
   aliases to a nick, then you could do this:
    <user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^*">

   The asterisk (*) means that it will match all nicks starting
   with 'Joe^'. So it will add all Joe^'s to 'Joe' in the stats.
   Another thing you can do is to add a picture to a user:
    <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_holiday.jpg">

   If you have a larger picture of the user as well, you can make
   the picture on the stats page link to it:
     <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_holiday.jpg" bigpic="ben-big.jpg">

   You can include * or ? to enable filename globbing to randomly
   choose one from several pictures: (see documentation for the
   ImageGlobPath option)
    <user nick="Ben" pic="ben_*.jpg">

   You can also set a user's sex. The sex setting can be "f"emale,
   "m"ale, or "b"ot:
    <user nick="Ben" sex="m">

   Also you can add links to URLs and e-mails:
    <user nick="Christine" link="http://www.christine.com">

   or
    <user nick="Chris" link="chris@host.com">

   The last thing you can do is to ignore nicks (for example
   bots):
    <user nick="nameofbot" ignore="y">

   You don't have to do all this in many lines, you could just as
   easily do:
    <user nick="Joe" alias="Joe^away Joe^work" pic="joe.jpg" link="joe@
joe.com" sex="m">

   (Here the aliases are a space separated list of nicks, that
   also works! But * as a wildcard is smarter, although it is
   slower).
     __________________________________________________________

Setting global options

   Many times, it will be useful to set up global options, global
   options are set like this:
     <set option="VALUE">

   Any global option will be overriden by anything defined within
   channel elements (see the Section called Setting up a channel)

   For example, to change the background color of the stats page,
   you could do:
     <set bgcolor="black">

   You can set many options in a single set:
     <set lang="DE" timeoffset="+1">

   The above will set the language on the statistics page to DE
   (Deutsch, German) and set the time offset to +1. All options
   available are mentioned in the reference documentation.
     __________________________________________________________

Ignoring links

   It's possible to ignore links in the "Most referenced URLs"
   section:

     <link url="http://www.slashdot.org" ignore="y">

     __________________________________________________________

Including common settings for various channels

   If you have, for example, more than one channel, where the
   users are the same, or you don't want to maintain more than one
   user file, you can use the "include" setting in the main config
   file:

     <include="/home/vetinari/pisg/users.cfg">


   This will include the file /home/vetinari/pisg/users.cfg in the
   config at the place where the include statement is set.

   Note, that you can NOT include a file from an included file!
     __________________________________________________________

Changing the layout of your stats page

   The standard layout and colors in the outputted HTML page are
   made to be somewhat clean and neutral. But you have the chance
   to change the layout yourself.

   There are a few predefined color schemes for you to use, use
   the ColorScheme option when using them. The colorschemes
   distributed with pisg are: default (which is the default),
   darkgalaxy, darkred, justgrey, ocean, orange_grey, pisg,
   softgreen.

   When changing it, you need a fair knowledge of CSS (Cascading
   Style Sheets). CSS is what most of the web uses today to define
   styles and layout on HTML pages. With the pisg distribution,
   look in the layout directory. In it resides default.css which
   is the file being included onto the HTML page. Open it in a
   text editor like vi or notepad. Then change it until you're
   happy with it. Be aware that you might want to look at the
   HiCell and HiCell2 options through pisg.cfg for changing the
   last two colors.

   If you have created a nice stylesheet which other can take
   advantage of, you are encouraged to send it to the pisg mailing
   list so that it can be distributed with the next version of
   pisg.

   If you want to embed the statistics into another page, use the
   "none" color scheme. Pisg will then omit the HTML header and
   write only the body part.
     __________________________________________________________

Running pisg

   When everything is set up in the pisg configuration file
   (pisg.cfg), then you simply run pisg on the command-line.

   Using Linux, BSD or another UNIX-like system:
    user@host:pisg-0.37$ ./pisg

   Using Windows:
    c:\pisg> perl pisg

   The program will run and parse the logfiles you specified in
   the configuration file.

   If you are using Linux, BSD or another UNIX-like system and
   want run pisg automatically several times a day, then see the
   crontab file in the scripts/ directory.

   For Windows, see the windows-upload-ftp.txt file with the pisg
   distribution, this file is also placed in the scripts/
   directory.
     __________________________________________________________

Obtaining help and reporting bugs

   If your problem could not be resolved through here, then you
   should send an e-mail to the pisg mailing list. You can
   subscribe and see more info at
   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pisg-general.

   If you believe that you have found a bug, you should use the
   SourceForge bug tracking system.

         Format = "eggdrop"
         Maintainer = "John"
        </channel>

        <set Format="mIRC">


Description
-----------

   Format is used to define the format of the logfile, pisg
   supports a various number of different logfiles, see the
   FORMATS file included with the pisg distribution. If your
   logfiles have the suffix .gz or .bz2, they will automatically
   be decompressed and read by pisg. See also Maintainer.

Default

   Unset

Network

-----------------------
Network option
-----------------------

   Network -- the IRC network of the channel

Synopsis
--------


        <channel="#channel">

         Network = "Undernet"
        </channel>

        <set Network="Quakenet">


Description
-----------

   Network is used to set the network which the channel resides
   on, this name is displayed on the stats page.

Default

   SomeIRCNetwork

OutputFile

-----------------------
OutputFile option
-----------------------

   OutputFile -- name of the generated HTML page

Synopsis
--------


        <channel="#channel">
         Logfile = "channel.log"
         Format = "eggdrop"
         OutputFile = "mychan.html"
        </channel>

        <set OutputFile="mychan.html">


Description
-----------

   OutputFile is used to define the name of the generated
   statistics page.

OutputTag

-----------------------
OutputTag option
-----------------------

   OutputTag -- tag to insert into OutputFile

Synopsis
--------


        <channel="#channel">
         LogDir = "logs/"
         Format = "eggdrop"
         OutputFile = "mychan%t.html"
         OutputTag = "-week"
        </channel>

        <set OutputTag="-week">


Description
-----------

   OutputTag specifies a string that will replace occurrences of
   "%t" in OutputFile. This option is most useful when used as a
   command line switch (-t) to pisg in conjunction with NFiles
   (-nf). Example:

      $ pisg -co pisg.conf
      $ pisg -co pisg.conf -nf 8 -t -week


   Leaving out the OutputTag settings from the above pisg.conf
   snippet, this writes both the full statistics (mychan.html) and
   statistics for the last week (mychan-week.html) using the same
   pisg config file. (Assuming that there are separate logfiles
   for each day.)

Default

   unset

         Format = "eggdrop"
        </channel>

        <set Logfile="foo.log">


Description
-----------

   This defines the filename of the logfile to parse for the
   channel. If you want to parse a directory full of logfiles, you
   should use the LogDir option instead. Providing this option
   multiple times will parse multiple files in the order the
   statements appear. Wildcards (* ? []) will be expanded. See
   also LogDir and NFiles.

Default

   unset

        </channel>

        <set LogDir="dailylogs/">


Description
-----------

   When LogDir is defined to valid path to a directory, then pisg
   will run through that directory, parse all logfiles in it and
   create one HTML page from it. Useful with for example eggdrop
   logs. Providing this option multiple times will parse all the
   files in multiple directories in the order the statements
   appear. See also NFiles, LogPrefix, and LogSuffix.

Default

   unset

   When NFiles is set to a positive integer, pisg will process
   only the last that much logfiles from Logfile and LogDir
   options. Useful to create statistics that cover the last week
   or month (assuming there are separate logfile per
   day/week/etc.).

Default

   0 (process all files)

Maintainer

        </channel>

        <set Maintainer="Benny">


Description
-----------

   Maintainer is used to define the name of the maintainer of the
   statistics page, this can be either the person generating the
   stats or the bot/client doing the logging. The maintainer is
   displayed in the outputted stats page. This setting is also
   used by some log parsers where "You" is used instead of the
   nick in the log (e.g. "You have been kicked"). See also Format,
   NickTracking.

Default

   MAINTAINER

ColorScheme

-----------------------
ColorScheme option

        </channel>

        <set ColorScheme="default">


Description
-----------

   ColorScheme is used to define the color scheme used for the
   statistics page. Actually it's the CSS file being included. CSS
   files distributed with pisg are: darkgalaxy, darkred, default,
   justgrey, ocean, orange_grey, pisg, softgreen (omit the .css).
   The file will be included statically in the generated HTML
   page. If you give a file name or URL (i.e. a color scheme name
   with .css or a path), the file will be linked to instead. Using
   "none" will cause pisg to write only the body of the page; use
   this to include the statistics into a custom page. See also
   CssDir, AltColorScheme, HiCell/HiCell2.

Default

   default

AltColorScheme

-----------------------

         PageHead = "myheader.txt"
        </channel>

        <set PageHead="someheader.txt">


Description
-----------

   PageHead is used to include a file in the stats page, for
   example an introduction text, a link to an image or a banner.
   The file can hold anything, it will be included raw in the

PageFoot

-----------------------
PageFoot option
-----------------------

         PageFoot = "myfooter.txt"
        </channel>

        <set PageFoot="somefooter.txt">


Description
-----------

   PageFoot is used to include a file in the stats page, for
   example an introduction text, a link to an image or a banner.
   The file can hold anything, it will be included raw in the
   stats page - so HTML should be preferred. The file will be
   included in the bottom of the page. This option is the opposite
   of PageHead.

Default

   none

LogPrefix

-----------------------
LogPrefix option
-----------------------

   LogPrefix -- only parse logs LogPrefixed with a user defined
   string

Synopsis
--------


        <channel="#channel">
         LogDir="/home/foo/eggdrop/logs/"
         Format = "eggdrop"
         LogPrefix = "logjun"
        </channel>

        <set LogPrefix="logjanuary">


Description
-----------

   When using the LogDir option and you only want to use a slew of
   the files in it, you can have pisg choose only files which are
   prefixed with a special string.

Default

   unset

LogSuffix

-----------------------
LogSuffix option
-----------------------

   LogSuffix -- Regexp to sort logfiles by format month||day||year

Synopsis
--------


        <set LogSuffix="\.\d\d([A-Za-z]+)\d\d\d\d||\.(\d\d)[A-Za-z]+\d\
d\d\d||\.\d\d[A-Za-z]+(\d\d\d\d)">


Description
-----------

   LogSuffix is used to define the suffix of a logfile, it only
   works when LogDir is defined. The example in the synopsis is
   for the eggdrop bots default format.

Default

   Unset

Silent

-----------------------
Silent option
-----------------------

   Silent -- make pisg silent, suppress messages

Synopsis
--------


        <set Silent="1">


Description
-----------

   This option is useful mainly from command line when invoking
   pisg with --silent 1. But it can also used in the configuration
   file. It will suppress all standard output from pisg. Error
   messages will still be sent.

Default

   0 (disabled)

CacheDir

-----------------------
CacheDir option
-----------------------

   CacheDir -- use a cache to speed up log parsing

Synopsis
--------


        <set CacheDir="pisg_cache">
        <set CacheDir="/path/to/pisg_cache">


Description
-----------

   Setting this option makes pisg dump the results of log parsing
   into cache files. The next time pisg is run, it compares the
   timestamp of the log(s) with the timestamp stored in the cache
   file. When the log was not changed, the cached data is used.
   (This means that it does not work if you only have a single big
   logfile. Split the log at arbitrary points and use LogDir or
   Logfile="dir/*".)

   Note that the cache files should be deleted when the pisg
   config file is changed since the cache data uses the old config
   settings. NickTracking does not work especially well with the
   cache when using different NFiles settings.

Default

   Unset

         Charset = "utf-8"
        </channel>

        <set Charset="iso-8859-15">


Description
-----------

   The pisg stats page defines a character set in a meta tag, this
   can be used if your country is using a different one than the
   default. Pisg will also use this setting to convert the
   language templates from LangFile if the language defines a
   source charset. Note: you also have to tell your webserver to
   transmit the charset to the browser. With Apache, use
   "AddDefaultCharset off" in the server config.

Default

   iso-8859-1

LogCharset

-----------------------
LogCharset option

        </channel>

        <set Charset="iso-8859-15">
        <set LogCharset="iso-8859-15">


Description
-----------

   If LogCharset is set and different from Charset, pisg will
   convert the charset using Text::Iconv. Using this option slows
   down log processing.

Default

   empty (no conversion)

LogCharsetFallback

-----------------------
LogCharsetFallback option
-----------------------

   LogCharsetFallback -- fallback character set for logfiles

Synopsis
--------


        <channel="#channel">

         LogCharset = "utf-8"
         LogCharsetFallback = "iso-8859-1"
        </channel>

        <set Charset="utf-8">
        <set LogCharset="utf-8">
        <set LogCharsetFallback="iso-8859-15">


Description
-----------

   LogCharsetFallback defines a fallback charset for the
   LogCharset conversion. This is useful if you have mixed
   unicode/iso-8859-* logs. Pisg will first try the conversion
   from LogCharset. If that fails, LogCharsetFallback is used.
   Note that this only works for charsets where certain byte
   sequences are illegal, like UTF-8. (In short: LogCharset =
   utf-8, LogCharsetFallback = iso-8859-15 works, the other way
   round does not.)

Default

   empty (no fallback conversion)

         TimeOffset = "+5"
        </channel>

        <set TimeOffset="+2">


Description
-----------

   By default, pisg uses the time of the local machine to display
   the time of the generated stats. Sometimes when you have a
   shell on an external box, and it's in another country, you want
   to use another time. This is accomplished by the TimeOffset
   command.

Default option
-----------------------

   HiCell, HiCell2 -- colors for color gradient in most active
   nicks section

Synopsis
--------


        <set HiCell="#BABADD" HiCell2="#CCCCCC">
        <set HiCell="">


Description
-----------

   HiCell and HiCell2 define the colors to be used for the color
   gradient in the most active nicks section. They should match
   your ColorScheme. When setting HiCell the empty string (""),
   pisg will not generate a color gradient; you might want to use
   this with ColorScheme="none" or AltColorScheme.

Default

   #BABADD, #CCCCCC

LogType

-----------------------
LogType option
-----------------------

   LogType -- type of log (not the format of the log)

Synopsis
--------


        <set LogType="Logfile">


Description
-----------

   The type of logs kept for your channel. Currently only
   "Logfile" is supported, so you don't need to change this
   option.

Default

   Logfile

StatsDump

-----------------------
StatsDump option
-----------------------

   StatsDump -- dump raw statistics into file

Synopsis
--------


        <set StatsDump="statsdump">


Description
-----------

   This option is intended for debugging pisg, but might be useful
   to process the parsed logs with another program. The file
   contains the %stats and %lines hashes in perl's Data::Dumper
   format.

Default

   Unset
