Supported logfile formats by pisg
=================================

This file contains a list of the different logfile formats which pisg
supports. It also includes a sample line for these formats.

If you don't have access to any of the clients/bots or you use some other
IRC client/bot which isn't supported, then it's fairly easy to add support
for a new IRC log format if you have some Perl knowledge, take a look at
modules/Pisg/Parser/Format/Template.pm. If you don't have any Perl
knowledge, then mail a sample logfile to the mailinglist (preferred as a
link to the logfile)

mIRC6
-----
  - Version 6.x of mIRC

  - Same as mIRC except it uses a retarded logging format that makes modes
    indeciperable from actions (which is a nightmare to parse)

  - DON'T USE IT if you can avoid it, it doesn't do very well at understanding
    modes (see the "mIRC6hack" format)

  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'mIRC6'.

  - Remember to timestamp your logs, or it wont work, the timestamp must be
    in [HH:MM] or [HH:MM:SS] format. (logging options -> timestamp logs)

mIRC6hack
---------
  - Version 6.x of mIRC using a logging script to produce a saner output

  - Same as mIRC6 except it uses '**' for actions

  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'mIRC6hack', and the following
    be added to mIRC's remote script section (Alt-R -> Remote): (thanks to
    virtuall and coaster)

   ------------------------------8<------------------------------
   alias me {
     if ($1) {
       .describe $active $1-
       echo $color(own) -qt $active ** $me $1-
     }
     else {
       echo $color(info) $active * /me: insufficient parameters
     }
   }

   on ^*:ACTION:*:*:{
     echo $color(action) -lt $iif($chan,$chan,$nick) ** $nick $1-
     haltdef
   }
   ------------------------------>8------------------------------

mIRC
----
  - A client for Windows (www.mirc.com)
  - If you want to create mIRC logfiles with your eggdrop, you can get some TCL
    which does it all for you (also logrotating and much more).

  - MEL (mIRCStats Eggdrop Logger) can be downloaded from the following URL:
    http://mel.angelbears.org/

  - Remember to timestamp your logs, or it wont work, the timestamp must be
    in [HH:MM] or [HH:MM:SS] format.
  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'mIRC'.

Example:

        [23:44] <Christina> Hello world

XChat
-----
  -  A client for Linux (www.xchat.org)
  -  In order to use this, format must be set to 'xchat'.
  -  Both the old logformat, and the new logformat from 1.8.7 and above is
     supported.

Example of old logformat:

        18:01:43 <Ben> Hello world

Example of new logformat:

        jan 13 04:39:42 <Ben> Hello World

XChat has changed its logformat again in early 2005. The "brand new" format
is broken in the same way as the mIRC6 format in that it is now impossible to
tell actions from real events. Additionally, the format of the lines in the
log changed. It is possible to revert to the previous format (the one that
pisg understands) by using the old text theme:
    http://xchat.org/files/themes/blacktheme.zip

Eggdrop
-------
  - A cool and advanced IRC bot for Linux (www.eggheads.org)

  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'eggdrop'.

You might want to change the logfile-suffix in order for pisg to parse the
files in the correct order when using 'logdir':

  set logfile-suffix ".%Y%m%d" instead of the standard format
  set logfile-suffix ".%d%b%Y".

Example:

        [00:02] <Jenny> Hello world

Grufti
------
  - A bot which I'm not really familiar with (www.grufti.com)
  - The author has actually made something like pisg called 'gruftistats',
    but someone mailed me and told me that it hadn't been maintained for
    over a year, and it had some problems..

  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'grufti'

Example:

        [00:17] <John> Hello world

bxlog
-----
  - A logging script for BitchX (console client - see scripts.bitchx.com)
  - In order to use this, format must be set to 'bxlog'
