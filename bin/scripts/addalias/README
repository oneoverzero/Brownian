Info:
--
This script is intended as an add-on for pisg
<http://pisg.sourceforge.net/>.  After seeing Addalias.pl by Doomshammer it
inspired me to write a more powerfull version of it which would also allow
people to change their information instead of just adding it. This way it
would allow me to enter some basic nicklinking info for those too lazy to do
it themselves.  I also decided to make it a script only version which would
not require additional html files and give it more configuration options.



Installation:
--
Make sure the webserver has read and write access to the pisg.cfg file (the
script will let you know when it has permissions to read or write).  Change
the $pisg_config variable to the location of the pisg.cfg file on your
system.  Put the addalias.pl file in the cgi-bin directory. You can link
directly to the addalias.pl, no need to add an html file to it.  If you want
to you can customise the text and layout (colors in the html head tag) of
the pages to your own liking or language by editing the appropriate
variables in addalias.pl. The names of the variables and default text should
explain themselves.
