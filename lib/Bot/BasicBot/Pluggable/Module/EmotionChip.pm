=head1 NAME

Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::EmotionChip - Bring some human emotion to an otherwise bland BasicBot

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<"I chose to believe that I was a person, that I had the potential to become more than a collection of circuits and subprocessors.">
-- B<Data>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<EmotionChip> is a module meant to add a flair of emotive personality to an otherwise cold bot.
With this module loaded the bot is able to recognize people within the channel (even if they change nicknames),
and recall particular interactions they have with it. In particular, whether they are nice to them or not.

The bot will maintain an internal karma meter, related to each person, regarding how much it loves them,
or hates them. Further interactions will depend on this internal scoring (eg, the bot might ignore some more than others).

=head1 LOADING

The module is near useless without its configuration file. Make sure you add it in.

    my $bot = Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable->new(
      ...
    );

    $bot->load("EmotionChip", { file => 'cfg/emotionchip.yml' });

=head1 IRC USAGE

    botslap
